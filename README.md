# MelodyBot3456
Melodybot3456 is a bot that generates random melodies and posts them to facebook and/or twitter.

A config file is required to be passed into the script for it to run; I'm planning on adding an example config file soon.

# Notes on Mingus
This project requires use of the Mingus library to work. Unfortunately, there is no official version of Mingus that works in Python 3. Instead, I found a repo of an attempt at translating the library for Python 3, edited it slightly to fit my purposes, and included it wholesale in the scope of this project. As such, I claim no authorship over anything inside the "mingus" folder.

# Requirements
MelodyBot relies on several programs outside of Python. The bot will not work without them so it is highly recommended to have these installed if you ever plan on trying to run this bot. In no particular order, they are:

* ffmpeg
* LilyPond
* FluidSynth

All of these are available for free. I may have forgotten something here, if you're having trouble please reach out to me at Fuddlebob@gmail.com
